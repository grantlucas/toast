#Toast - The Personal Media Host

Instead of relying on service like Twipic and yFrog, Toast allows you to host
your own media on your own server. You no longer have to worry about how 3rd
party services are using your images and data or who owns the copyright to what.

## When would I use Toast?

- Host images and video for when posting to social sites like Twitter or App.net
    - Each piece of content is given a short, unique path and if you combine
      that with a short domain name, no use of a URL shortener would be needed
      when posting.
    - Some clients like Tweetbot allow you to set custom image and video
      services.  Toast ties into these perfectly so once setup, media is just
      posted through your client.
- Host your images and video for your blog
    - The way CMS's store media can vary drastically. If you want to move your
      site's content to another platform you also have to worry about the paths
      to images within posts. By separating the storage of your media from your
      main site, changing platforms is as easy as copying over your content. No
      link changes needed.

Toast acts as a permanent repository for your images and video whether it ends
up on your personal site or in a social media service.
